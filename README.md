# image-curved-triangulation

This program is the implementation of the paper '[Xiao, Yanyang, Cao, Juan, and Chen, Zhonggui. Image Representation on Curved Optimal Triangulation. Computer Graphics Forum, 2022, 41(6), 23-36](https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.14495)'

Part of the implementation has been optimized, which is slightly different from what is described in the paper.
